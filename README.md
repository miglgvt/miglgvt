# Welcome to My Bioinformatics Journey! üß¨üîç

Hi! I'm @miglgvt, a passionate bioinformatics student working at the intersection of biology and mathematics/programming. 

## üß™ About Me

I'm a Bioinformatics and Systems Biology MSc student @DTU, and a Biomedical Science graduate from UoM. I'm fueled by curiosity, a love for problem-solving, and a relentless pursuit of knowledge. My background before getting into bioinformatics work is mainly on immunology and cancer biology, with my final year project focusing on Prostate Cancer.

## üöÄ My Goals

- **Bridging the Gap**: My main objective is to blend the frontiers of biological knowledge with the power of data analysis, aiming to generate novel insights. Through this integration, I seek to contribute to the development of innovative knowledge that goes beyond conventional boundaries.
 
- **Biological Mathematics**: My secondary focus is to delve into mathematical underpinnings of biology. I aim to acquire a profound grasp of the quantitative aspects that drive life sciences, to understand the mathematical models governing biological processes.

- **Computing Skills**: Beyond specialized bioinformatics tools, I am dedicated to honing broad and transferable programming and computing skills. Aiming for proficiency in languages such as Python, R, SQL, and shell scripting, I seek to develop a comprehensive skill set that extends beyond the boundaries of bioinformatics.


## üíª Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python and R, tidyverse and base, are my go-to languages, but I also dabble in SQL, Matlab, HTML and CSS, and bash/zsh. 

- **Tools & Libraries:** I'm experienced in popular bioinformatics tools like BLAST, DESeq2, PyMol, COBRA toolbox; and in commmon Python libraries such as PyTorch, Numpy, Sklearn. Within R I have experience with the whole Tidyverse and to a smaller degree Shiny apps. I also have limited experience with Docker and KNIME.
  
- **Methods:** I am working on developing my knowledge of machine learning methods, having worked with basic regression and classification models, and ANN.
  
- **Version Control:** Git is my trusted companion for tracking changes and collaborating on projects.

## üìö Learning Path

- **Courses:** I've taken courses in NGS, Machine Learning Algorithms, Statistical Genetics, Systems Biology, Immunological Bioinformatics, and Network Analysis. I will be taking courses on Bayesian machine-learning approaches, Single-cell omics, and High Performance computing in the coming months.

- **Projects:** Check out my GitHub repositories for a glimpse of my hands-on projects (public projects coming soon).

- **Books:** I'm constantly exploring the latest bioinformatics literature.

## ü§ù Let's Collaborate!

I'm always open to collaboration, whether it's on a research project, coding challenge, or just exchanging knowledge. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-gonvaltej/) or send me an email miguelgonval@gmail.com!

Feel free to reach out if you have questions, ideas, or just want to geek out about bioinformatics or ML! üåêüß¨

Happy coding!
Miguel
